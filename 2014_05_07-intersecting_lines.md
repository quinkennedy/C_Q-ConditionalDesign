#Movement Study 2
##Setup
* Set a [metronome](http://webmetronome.com/?t=50&b=4&a=1000) at 50bpm, with an accent on the first of every four beats.
* The participants have four counts to complete each instruction.

##Instructions
1. Person B makes a straight line in space
2. Person A makes a straight line _that intersects_ Person B's line
3. Person B curves their line, rotates the curve and reestablishes a straight line _that does not intersect_ Person A's line
4. Person A curves their line, rotates the curve and reestablishes a straight line _that does intersect_ Person B's line
5. Repeat 3 & 4 again & again for 5 minutes

###Thoughts
Lines can be formed by any or all parts of the body. Lines should be imagined to extend in both directions from the body across the space. Lines can intersect at any point, imagined or physicalized. While curving/reestablishing lines in space, participants can travel through space.
