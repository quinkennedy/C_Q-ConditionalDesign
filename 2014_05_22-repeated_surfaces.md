#Silhouette Study 1
##Impetus
We were interested in creating a composition which emphasised, not necessarily movement, but energy in a pose. 

##Instructions
1. One person captures a pose
* The participants take turns repeating step 3 and 4
* Choose an exposed surface of the silhouette of the previous participant. 
    * If the previous silhouette does not have any exposed surfaces, choose any exposed surface in the image
* cuddle the surface without overlapping any previous silhouette with yours

###Thoughts
* The excersise stops when there are no exposed surfaces available
* There is an intentional loophole in step 4 which allows the silhouettes of other elements to overlap with previous silhouettes

###Afterthoughts
* The resulting image does not appear to emphasise energy as hoped, but becomes a puzzle of intersecting abstract bodily pieces which decays during the capture process.
* Instead of forcing participants to fill the frame, perhaps it would have created clearer compositions to conclude one study, and then begin a new one.
