# Exquisite Corps #

### Discussion ###
Our last experiment, Sillouette Study, developed into a process of composing static shapes in reference to the frame of the camera.  The most interesting choices were ones that took into account form, optics, proximity, and frame. In developing our next experiment we were interested in moving from static shapes into capturing movement patterns. We decided to create an Exquisite Corpse experiment.

The original Exquisite Corpse games were developed in 1925 by Andre Breton and fellow Surrealists.  The games were comprised of the collective assembly of words and images either by 1. only being allowed to view the end or very edge of the last person's contribution or 2. following rules to make a contribution in relation to what has come before, such as, adjective noun adverb verb: "the green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge" or "the exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine."

In crafting our experiment, debate ensued over whether there is something fundamental to Exquisite Corpse that is in direct opposition to the stated goals of Conditional Design, in particular the surrealist interest in arbitrary randomness.  In revisiting the manifesto, we renewed our interest in the intention to design a process based experiment which clearly demonstrates the passage of time, the interdependent relationship of the creative choices of the participants, and the changes that occur within these relationships in response to the accumulation of a history of choice making.  Strict, logical rule making still seems central to our explorations as a way to highlight human choice and encourage individuality by allowing for mischief, push-back, imagination, and the inevitability of rule breaking.

With all this in mind, we structure our Exquisite Corps experiment around premise 2. following rules. We agreed to design our instructions in such a way that each contributor has knowledge of the entire history of choice making made previously in the experiment.  The initial step of the experiment would be to match the last form that the previous participant inhabited, but choices could be made in relationship to everything that has come before.


# The Exquisite Corps Movement Study 1 #

### Set-Up ###
The program should record video for three seconds and display just the very last frame of movement onto a playback screen.

### Instructions ###
1.  Match your body to the form of the person as shown in the last frame of the video preceding your turn.
2.  Make 1 movement in 1 direction changing level.  The program will record 3 seconds of video of your movement.

### Conditions ###
The whole body should change level as opposed to just one body part.
Movement directions should be made on the plane parallel to the lens of the camera.
You should match the shape of the previous participants body but the background (ie your location) can be different.




# Movement Study 2 #

### Discussion ###
The first Movement Study seemed stilted.  There was too much time spent between turns planning and preparing for action.  We made a commitment to let go of the specificity of matching shape, instead reframing the idea as matching a moment of caught movement.  We also removed the limitations of directionality and quantity of movements.  We kept only matching the shape and changing levels.

### Instructions ###
1. Match your body to the form of the person as shown in the last frame of the video preceding your turn.  Envision this form as arrested movement instead of static shape.
2.  Continue the "phrase of movement" while changing levels.

### Conditions ###
Keep the times between turns quite brisk as to promote spontaneity.
The whole body should change level as opposed to just one body part.
You should match the shape of the previous participants body but the background (ie your location) can be different.




# Movement Study 3 #

### Discussion ###
We were interested in further developing a sense of reactivity and relationship between participants.  We decided that each turn should be in direct response to the one that has come before.   We removed the limitation of changing levels.

### Instructions ###
1.  Flip a coin to determine if you will be retrograding the movement phrase of the previous participant's contribution or if you will be continuing the phrase that you imagine they were developing.
2.  Match your body to the form of the person as shown in the last frame of the video preceding your turn.  Envision this form as arrested movement instead of static shape.
3.  Retrograde or Continue the phrase for 3 seconds as it is captured by video.

### Conditions ###
Keep the times between turns quite brisk as to promote spontaneity.
You should match the shape of the previous participants body but the background (ie your location) can be different.
A retrograde of a retrograde goes forward.




# Afterthoughts for Future Studies #
1.  Ascending or Descending:  Each participant would flip a coin to see if they were to continue ascending or descending from their beginning form.  This could be done in conjunction with the Retrograde or Continue structure.
2.  The camera could be on a rolling chair as to aid in the shifting of location and background.
