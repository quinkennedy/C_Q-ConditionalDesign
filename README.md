[Christiana Axelsen](http://vimeo.com/3701213) and [I](http://quinkennedy.com/) have begun an exploration together and decided to use the approach outlined as [Conditional Design](http://conditionaldesign.org) by [Studio Moniker](http://studiomoniker.com). This initial exploration of Conditional Design as outlined by the [Conditional Design Manifesto](http://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto) and exemplified by the projects at http://conditionaldesign.org (and perhaps by projects at http://thursdays.studiomoniker.com ) is planned to last at least for 5 short worshop sessions.

The rest of this document will outline our thoughts, musings, findings, experiences, and understandings around the Conditional Design Manifesto (CDM), how that is applied to an embodied practice (whether that be ÎéÎídanceÎéÎí, the body as a tool, or somewhere else along that non-linear continuum).
